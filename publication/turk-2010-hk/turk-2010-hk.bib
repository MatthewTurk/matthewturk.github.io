 abstract = {The analysis of complex multiphysics astrophysical simulations
presents a unique and rapidly growing set of challenges:
reproducibility, parallelization, and vast increases in data
size and complexity chief among them. In order to meet these
challenges, and in order to open up new avenues for
collaboration between users of multiple simulation platforms, we
present yt (available at http://yt.enzotools.org/) an open
source, community-developed astrophysical analysis and
visualization toolkit. Analysis and visualization with yt are
oriented around physically relevant quantities rather than
quantities native to astrophysical simulation codes. While
originally designed for handling Enzo's structure adaptive mesh
refinement data, yt has been extended to work with several
different simulation methods and simulation codes including
Orion, RAMSES, and FLASH. We report on its methods for reading,
handling, and visualizing data, including projections,
multivariate volume rendering, multi-dimensional histograms,
halo finding, light cone generation, and topologically connected
isocontour identification. Furthermore, we discuss the
underlying algorithms yt uses for processing and visualizing
data, and its mechanisms for parallelization of analysis tasks.},
