 abstract = {By definition, Population III stars are metal-free, and their
protostellar collapse is driven by molecular hydrogen cooling in
the gas phase, leading to large characteristic masses.
Population II stars with lower characteristic masses form when
the star-forming gas reaches a critical metallicity of
10--6-10--3.5 Z ☉. We present an adaptive mesh refinement
radiation hydrodynamics simulation that follows the transition
from Population III to Population II star formation. The maximum
spatial resolution of 1 comoving parsec allows for individual
molecular clouds to be well resolved and their stellar
associations to be studied in detail. We model stellar radiative
feedback with adaptive ray tracing. A top-heavy initial mass
function for the Population III stars is considered, resulting
in a plausible distribution of pair-instability supernovae and
associated metal enrichment. We find that the gas fraction
recovers from 5% to nearly the cosmic fraction in halos with
merger histories rich in halos above 107 M ☉. A single
pair-instability supernova is sufficient to enrich the host halo
to a metallicity floor of 10--3 Z ☉ and to transition to
Population II star formation. This provides a natural
explanation for the observed floor on damped Ly$α$ systems
metallicities reported in the literature, which is of this
order. We find that stellar metallicities do not necessarily
trace stellar ages, as mergers of halos with established stellar
populations can create superpositions of t--Z evolutionary
tracks. A bimodal metallicity distribution is created after a
starburst occurs when the halo can cool efficiently through
atomic line cooling.},
