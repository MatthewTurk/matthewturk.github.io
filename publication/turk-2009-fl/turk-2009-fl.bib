 abstract = {Previous high-resolution cosmological simulations predicted that
the first stars to appear in the early universe were very massive
and formed in isolation. Here, we discuss a cosmological
simulation in which the central 50 M(o) (where M(o) is the mass
of the Sun) clump breaks up into two cores having a mass ratio of
two to one, with one fragment collapsing to densities of 10(-8)
grams per cubic centimeter. The second fragment, at a distance of
approximately 800 astronomical units, is also optically thick to
its own cooling radiation from molecular hydrogen lines but is
still able to cool via collision-induced emission. The two dense
peaks will continue to accrete from the surrounding cold gas
reservoir over a period of approximately 10(5) years and will
likely form a binary star system.},
