 abstract = {Numerous cosmological hydrodynamic studies have addressed the
formation of galaxies. Here we choose to study the first stages
of galaxy formation, including nonequilibrium atomic primordial
gas cooling, gravity, and hydrodynamics. Using initial
conditions appropriate for the concordance cosmological model of
structure formation, we perform two adaptive mesh refinement
simulations of 108 Mâ˜‰ galaxies at high redshift. The
calculations resolve the Jeans length at all times with more
than 16 cells and capture over 14 orders of magnitude in length
scales. In both cases, the dense, 105 solar mass, one parsec
central regions are found to contract rapidly and have turbulent
Mach numbers up to 4. Despite the ever decreasing Jeans length
of the isothermal gas, we only find one site of fragmentation
during the collapse. However, rotational secular bar
instabilities transport angular momentum outward in the central
parsec as the gas continues to collapse and lead to multiple
nested unstable fragments with decreasing masses down to
sub-Jupiter mass scales. Although these numerical experiments
neglect star formation and feedback, they clearly highlight the
physics of turbulence in gravitationally collapsing gas. The
angular momentum segregation seen in our calculations plays an
important role in theories that form supermassive black holes
from gaseous collapse.},
