 abstract = {We investigate the spatially resolved star formation relation
using a galactic disk formed in a comprehensive high-resolution
(3.8 pc) simulation. Our new implementation of stellar feedback
includes ionizing radiation as well as supernova explosions, and
we handle ionizing radiation by solving the radiative transfer
equation rather than by a subgrid model. Photoheating by stellar
radiation stabilizes gas against Jeans fragmentation, reducing
the star formation rate (SFR). Because we have self-consistently
calculated the location of ionized gas, we are able to make
simulated, spatially resolved observations of star formation
tracers, such as H$α$ emission. We can also observe how
stellar feedback manifests itself in the correlation between
ionized and molecular gas. Applying our techniques to the disk
in a galactic halo of 2.3 $\times$ 1011 M ☉, we find that the
correlation between SFR density (estimated from mock H$α$
emission) and H2 density shows large scatter, especially at high
resolutions of ≲75 pc that are comparable to the size of giant
molecular clouds (GMCs). This is because an aperture of GMC size
captures only particular stages of GMC evolution and because
H$α$ traces hot gas around star-forming regions and is
displaced from the H2 peaks themselves. By examining the
evolving environment around star clusters, we speculate that the
breakdown of the traditional star formation laws of the
Kennicutt-Schmidt type at small scales is further aided by a
combination of stars drifting from their birthplaces and
molecular clouds being dispersed via stellar feedback.},
