 abstract = {The Dark Sky Simulations are an ongoing series of
cosmological N-body simulations designed to provide a
quantitative and accessible model of the evolution of the
large-scale Universe. Such models are essential for many
aspects of the study of dark matter and dark energy, since
we lack a sufficiently accurate analytic model of non-linear
gravitational clustering. In July 2014, we made available to
the general community our early data release, consisting of
over 55 Terabytes of simulation data products, including our
largest simulation to date, which used $1.07 \times
10^\12\~(10240^3)$ particles in a volume
$8h^\-1\\mathrm\Gpc\$ across. Our simulations were
performed with 2HOT, a purely tree-based adaptive N-body
method, running on 200,000 processors of the Titan
supercomputer, with data analysis enabled by yt. We provide
an overview of the derived halo catalogs, mass function,
power spectra and light cone data. We show self-consistency
in the mass function and mass power spectrum at the 1%
level over a range of more than 1000 in particle mass. We
also present a novel method to distribute and access very
large datasets, based on an abstraction of the World Wide
Web (WWW) as a file system, remote memory-mapped file access
semantics, and a space-filling curve index. This method has
been implemented for our data release, and provides a means
to not only query stored results such as halo catalogs, but
also to design and deploy new analysis techniques on large
distributed datasets.},
