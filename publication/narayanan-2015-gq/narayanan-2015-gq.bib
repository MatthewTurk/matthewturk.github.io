 abstract = {Submillimetre-bright galaxies at high redshift are the most
luminous, heavily star-forming galaxies in the Universe and are
characterized by prodigious emission in the far-infrared, with a
flux of at least five millijanskys at a wavelength of 850
micrometres. They reside in haloes with masses about 10(13) times
that of the Sun, have low gas fractions compared to main-sequence
disks at a comparable redshift, trace complex environments and
are not easily observable at optical wavelengths. Their physical
origin remains unclear. Simulations have been able to form
galaxies with the requisite luminosities, but have otherwise been
unable to simultaneously match the stellar masses, star formation
rates, gas fractions and environments. Here we report a
cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulation that is
able to form a submillimetre galaxy that simultaneously satisfies
the broad range of observed physical constraints. We find that
groups of galaxies residing in massive dark matter haloes have
increasing rates of star formation that peak at collective rates
of about 500-1,000 solar masses per year at redshifts of two to
three, by which time the interstellar medium is sufficiently
enriched with metals that the region may be observed as a
submillimetre-selected system. The intense star formation rates
are fuelled in part by the infall of a reservoir gas supply
enabled by stellar feedback at earlier times, not through major
mergers. With a lifetime of nearly a billion years, our
simulations show that the submillimetre-bright phase of
high-redshift galaxies is prolonged and associated with
significant mass buildup in early-Universe proto-clusters, and
that many submillimetre-bright galaxies are composed of numerous
unresolved components (for which there is some observational
evidence).},
