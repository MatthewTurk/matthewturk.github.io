 abstract = {Software that processes real-world data or that models a
physical system must have some way of managing units. While
simple approaches like the understood convention that all
data are in a unit system (such as the MKS SI unit system)
do work in practice, they are fraught with possible sources
of error both by developers and users of the software. In
this paper we present unyt, a Python library based on NumPy
and SymPy for handling data that has units. It is designed
both to aid quick interactive calculations and to be tightly
integrated into a larger Python application or library. We
compare unyt with two other Python libraries for handling
units, Pint and astropy.units, and find that unyt is faster,
has higher test coverage, and has fewer lines of code.},
