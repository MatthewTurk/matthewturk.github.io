 abstract = {We present the grackle chemistry and cooling library for
astrophysical simulations and models. grackle provides a
treatment of non-equilibrium primordial chemistry and cooling
for H, D and He species, including H2 formation on dust grains;
tabulated primordial and metal cooling; multiple ultraviolet
background models; and support for radiation transfer and
arbitrary heat sources. The library has an easily implementable
interface for simulation codes written in c, c++ and fortran as
well as a python interface with added convenience functions for
semi-analytical models. As an open-source project, grackle
provides a community resource for accessing and disseminating
astrochemical data and numerical methods. We present the full
details of the core functionality, the simulation and python
interfaces, testing infrastructure, performance and range of
applicability. grackle is a fully open-source project and new
contributions are welcome.},
