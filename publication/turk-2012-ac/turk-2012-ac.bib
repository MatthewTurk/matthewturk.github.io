 abstract = {We study the buildup of magnetic fields during the formation of
Population III star-forming regions by conducting cosmological
simulations from realistic initial conditions and varying the
Jeans resolution. To investigate this in detail, we start
simulations from identical initial conditions, mandating 16, 32,
and 64 zones per Jeans length, and study the variation in their
magnetic field amplification. We find that, while compression
results in some amplification, turbulent velocity fluctuations
driven by the collapse can further amplify an initially weak
seed field via dynamo action, provided there is sufficient
numerical resolution to capture vortical motions (we find this
requirement to be 64 zones per Jeans length, slightly larger
than but consistent with previous work run with more idealized
collapse scenarios). We explore saturation of amplification of
the magnetic field, which could potentially become dynamically
important in subsequent, fully resolved calculations. We have
also identified a relatively surprising phenomenon that is
purely hydrodynamic: the higher-resolved simulations possess
substantially different characteristics, including higher infall
velocity, increased temperatures inside 1000 AU, and decreased
molecular hydrogen content in the innermost region. Furthermore,
we find that disk formation is suppressed in higher-resolution
calculations, at least at the times that we can follow the
calculation. We discuss the effect this may have on the buildup
of disks over the accretion history of the first clump to form
as well as the potential for gravitational instabilities to
develop and induce fragmentation.},
