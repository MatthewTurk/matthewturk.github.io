 abstract = {Multi-scale models can facilitate whole plant simulations by
linking gene networks, protein synthesis, metabolic pathways,
physiology, and growth. Whole plant models can be further
integrated with ecosystem, weather, and climate models to predict
how various interactions respond to environmental perturbations.
These models have the potential to fill in missing mechanistic
details and generate new hypotheses to prioritize directed
engineering efforts. Outcomes will potentially accelerate
improvement of crop yield, sustainability, and increase future
food security. It is time for a paradigm shift in plant modeling,
from largely isolated efforts to a connected community that takes
advantage of advances in high performance computing and
mechanistic understanding of plant processes. Tools for guiding
future crop breeding and engineering, understanding the
implications of discoveries at the molecular level for whole
plant behavior, and improved prediction of plant and ecosystem
responses to the environment are urgently needed. The purpose of
this perspective is to introduce Crops in silico
(cropsinsilico.org), an integrative and multi-scale modeling
platform, as one solution that combines isolated modeling efforts
toward the generation of virtual crops, which is open and
accessible to the entire plant biology community. The major
challenges involved both in the development and deployment of a
shared, multi-scale modeling platform, which are summarized in
this prospectus, were recently identified during the first Crops
in silico Symposium and Workshop.},
