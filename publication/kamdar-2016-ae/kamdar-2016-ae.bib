 abstract = {We present a new exploratory framework to model galaxy formation
and evolution in a hierarchical Universe by using machine
learning (ML). Our motivations are two-fold: (1) presenting a
new, promising technique to study galaxy formation, and (2)
quantitatively analysing the extent of the influence of dark
matter halo properties on galaxies in the backdrop of
semi-analytical models (SAMs). We use the influential Millennium
Simulation and the corresponding Munich SAM to train and test
various sophisticated ML algorithms (k-Nearest Neighbors,
decision trees, random forests, and extremely randomized trees).
By using only essential dark matter halo physical properties for
haloes of M > 1012 MâŠ™ and a partial merger tree, our model
predicts the hot gas mass, cold gas mass, bulge mass, total
stellar mass, black hole mass and cooling radius at z = 0 for
each central galaxy in a dark matter halo for the Millennium
run. Our results provide a unique and powerful phenomenological
framework to explore the galaxy--halo connection that is built
upon SAMs and demonstrably place ML as a promising and a
computationally efficient tool to study small-scale structure
formation.},
