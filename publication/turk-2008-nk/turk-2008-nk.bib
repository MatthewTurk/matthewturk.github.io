 abstract = {Modeling the formation of the first stars in the universe is a
well?posed problem and ideally suited for computational
investigation.We have conducted high?resolution numerical
studies of the formation of primordial stars. Beginning with
primordial initial conditions appropriate for a ?CDM model, we
used the Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement code (Enzo) to
achieve unprecedented numerical resolution, resolving
cosmological scales as well as sub?stellar scales
simultaneously. Building on the work of Abel, Bryan and Norman
(2002), we followed the evolution of the first collapsing cloud
until molecular hydrogen is optically thick to cooling
radiation. In addition, the calculations account for the process
of collision?induced emission (CIE) and add approximations to
the optical depth in both molecular hydrogen roto?vibrational
cooling and CIE. Also considered are the effects of chemical
heating/cooling from the formation/destruction of molecular
hydrogen. We present the results of these simulations, showing
the formation of a 10 Jupiter?mass protostellar core bounded by
a strongly aspherical accretion shock. Accretion rates are found
to be as high as one solar mass per year.},
