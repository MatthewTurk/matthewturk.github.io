 abstract = {The act of sharing scientific knowledge is rapidly evolving away
from traditional articles and presentations to the delivery of
executable objects that integrate the data and computational
details (e.g., scripts and workflows) upon which the findings
rely. This envisioned coupling of data and process is essential
to advancing science but faces technical and institutional
barriers. The Whole Tale project aims to address these barriers
by connecting computational, data-intensive research efforts
with the larger research process---transforming the knowledge
discovery and dissemination process into one where data products
are united with research articles to create ``living
publications'' or tales. The Whole Tale focuses on the full
spectrum of science, empowering users in the long tail of
science, and power users with demands for access to big data and
compute resources. We report here on the design, architecture,
and implementation of the Whole Tale environment.},
