 abstract = {Here we present three adaptive mesh refinement radiation
hydrodynamics simulations that illustrate the impact of momentum
transfer from ionising radiation to the absorbing gas on star
formation in high-redshift dwarf galaxies. Momentum transfer is
calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation with a ray
tracing algorithm that is adaptive in spatial and angular
coordinates. We find that momentum input partially affects star
formation by increasing the turbulent support to a
three-dimensional rms velocity equal to the circular velocity of
early haloes. Compared to a calculation that neglects radiation
pressure, the star formation rate is decreased by a factor of
five to 1.8 ? 10?2 M? yr?1 in a dwarf galaxy with a dark matter
and stellar mass of 2.0 ? 108 M? and 4.5 ? 105 M?, respectively,
when radiation pressure is included. Its mean metallicity of
10?2.1 Z? is consistent with the observed dwarf galaxy
luminosity-metallicity relation. In addition to photo-heating in
H II regions, radiation pressure further drives dense gas from
star forming regions, so supernovae feedback occurs in a warmer
and more diffuse medium, launching metal-rich outflows.},
