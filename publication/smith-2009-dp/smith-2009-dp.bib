 abstract = {Simulations of the formation of Population III (Pop III) stars
suggest that they were much more massive than the Pop II and Pop
I stars observed today. This is due to the collapse dynamics of
metal-free gas, which is regulated by the radiative cooling of
molecular hydrogen. We study how the collapse of gas clouds is
altered by the addition of metals to the star-forming
environment by performing a series of simulations of
pre-enriched star formation at various metallicities. To make a
clean comparison with metal-free star formation, we use initial
conditions identical to a Pop III star formation simulation,
with low ionization and no external radiation other than the
cosmic microwave background (CMB). For metallicities below the
critical metallicity, Z cr, collapse proceeds similar to the
metal-free case, and only massive objects form. For
metallicities well above Z cr, efficient cooling rapidly lowers
the gas temperature to the temperature of the CMB. The gas is
unable to radiatively cool below the CMB temperature, and
becomes thermally stable. For high metallicities, Z ≳ 10--2.5 Z
☉, this occurs early in the evolution of the gas cloud, when the
density is still relatively low. The resulting cloud cores show
little or no fragmentation, and would most likely form massive
stars. If the metallicity is not vastly above Z cr, the cloud
cools efficiently but does not reach the CMB temperature, and
fragmentation into multiple objects occurs. We conclude that
there were three distinct modes of star formation at high
redshift (z ≳ 4): a ``primordial'' mode, producing massive stars
(10s to 100s of M ☉) at very low metallicities (Z ≲ 10--3.75 Z
☉); a CMB-regulated mode, producing moderate mass (10s of M ☉)
stars at high metallicities (Z ≳ 10--2.5 Z ☉ at redshift z∼
15-20); and a low-mass (a few M ☉) mode existing between these
two metallicities. As the universe ages and the CMB temperature
decreases, the range of the low-mass mode extends to higher
metallicities, eventually becoming the only mode of star
formation.},
