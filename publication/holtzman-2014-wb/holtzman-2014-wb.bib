 abstract = {We construct a representation of earthquakes and global seismic
waves through sound and animated images. The seismic wave field
is the ensemble of elastic waves that propagate through the
planet after an earthquake, emanating from the rupture on the
fault. The sounds are made by time compression (i.e. speeding
up) of seismic data with minimal additional processing. The
animated images are renderings of numerical simulations of
seismic wave propagation in the globe. Synchronized sounds and
images reveal complex patterns and illustrate numerous aspects
of the seismic wave field. These movies represent phenomena
occurring far from the time and length scales normally
accessible to us, creating a profound experience for the
observer. The multi-sensory perception of these complex
phenomena may also bring new insights to researchers.},
