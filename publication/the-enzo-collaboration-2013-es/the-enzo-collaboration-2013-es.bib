 abstract = {This paper describes the open-source code Enzo, which uses
block-structured adaptive mesh refinement to provide high
spatial and temporal resolution for modeling astrophysical
fluid flows. The code is Cartesian, can be run in 1, 2, and
3 dimensions, and supports a wide variety of physics
including hydrodynamics, ideal and non-ideal
magnetohydrodynamics, N-body dynamics (and, more broadly,
self-gravity of fluids and particles), primordial gas
chemistry, optically-thin radiative cooling of primordial
and metal-enriched plasmas (as well as some optically-thick
cooling models), radiation transport, cosmological
expansion, and models for star formation and feedback in a
cosmological context. In addition to explaining the
algorithms implemented, we present solutions for a wide
range of test problems, demonstrate the code's parallel
performance, and discuss the Enzo collaboration's code
development methodology.},
