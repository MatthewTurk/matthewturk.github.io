 abstract = {The transformation of atomic hydrogen to molecular hydrogen
through three-body reactions is a crucial stage in the collapse
of primordial, metal-free halos, where the first generation of
stars (Population III stars) in the universe is formed. However,
in the published literature, the rate coefficient for this
reaction is uncertain by nearly an order of magnitude. We report
on the results of both adaptive mesh refinement and smoothed
particle hydrodynamics simulations of the collapse of metal-free
halos as a function of the value of this rate coefficient. For
each simulation method, we have simulated a single halo three
times, using three different values of the rate coefficient. We
find that while variation between halo realizations may be
greater than that caused by the three-body rate coefficient
being used, both the accretion physics onto Population III
protostars as well as the long-term stability of the disk and
any potential fragmentation may depend strongly on this rate
coefficient.},
